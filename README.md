This is the solution to the MEDNAX vending machine take home assignment.

Assumptions
---
For the purposes of this exercise, we're making a few assumptions:
* Building a VendingMachine object and providing a few methods on that object to perform the necessary tasks is acceptable
* For the purposes of making change, we have a limitless number of coins of each denomination
* For the purposes of vending product, we have an limitless number of each product

Future refactorings and improvements can be made to address these assumptions if they turn out to be problematic

Instructions
---
To install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

To run the tests:
```
make test
```

To run the application:
```
