This is the solution to the MEDNAX vending machine take home assignment.

Assumptions
---
For the purposes of this exercise, we're making a few assumptions:
* Building a VendingMachine object and providing a few methods on that object to perform the necessary tasks is acceptable
* For the purposes of making change, we have a limitless number of coins of each denomination
* For the purposes of vending product, we have a limitless supply of each product
* The tests running in [github actions](https://github.com/dlwire/vending-machine-take-home-public/actions) and in a fresh install with python 3.9.6 is sufficient for this increment

Future refactorings and improvements can be made to address these assumptions if they turn out to be problematic

Instructions
---
NOTE: This will run on a clean linux or osx install with python 3.9.6

To install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

To run the tests:
```
make test
```
